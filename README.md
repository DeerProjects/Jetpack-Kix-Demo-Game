🚀 Jetpack Kix

A UE5 Blueprint platformer prototype built during Unreal Engine 5 Blueprints - The Ultimate Developer Course (Udemy)

🎮 Overview

Jetpack Kix is a third-person platforming prototype built in Unreal Engine 5.
In this game, the player uses a jetpack to fly between floating platforms, collect fuel pickups, and reach the final platform before running out of energy.

The project was created during the Ultimate Unreal Developer Course on Udemy (by GameDev.tv), where I learned the fundamentals of Unreal Engine.
After completing the course content, I expanded the project by adding custom Blueprint logic, enhanced input mappings, modular interfaces, and complete gameplay polish to create a standalone, playable experience.

🧠 Core Features

✈️ Jetpack System
Custom thrust and gravity logic using Blueprint math to simulate smooth, responsive flight.
Includes fuel drain, cooldown, and recharge mechanics.

🔋 Fuel Pickups
Rotating fuel pickups that restore jetpack energy and trigger particle + sound effects.

🟢 Win Zones & Pressure Plates
Blueprint-triggered areas that detect player interaction and display a win UI upon completion.

💻 Enhanced Input System (UE5)
Fully configured input mapping contexts for Move, Look, Jump, and Jetpack.
Designed using Unreal’s modern input framework for precision and scalability.

🧩 Blueprint Interfaces
Modular communication system between Game Mode, Player Controller, and Jetpack components — ensuring flexible event-driven gameplay.

🎞️ Animation System
Blendspace + state machine system for seamless transitions between locomotion and flying states.

🪄 User Interface (UI)
Dynamic HUD displaying jetpack fuel, plus win/lose condition screens created with UMG Widgets.

⚙️ Gameplay Loop

Move and jump across platforms using standard controls.

Use the jetpack to navigate between distant platforms.

Manage your fuel supply carefully — it drains during flight but can be refilled by pickups.

Reach the final platform and trigger the win condition to complete the level.

Move	WASD	Move the character
Look	Mouse	Rotate camera
Jump	Space	Standard jump
Jetpack	Left Shift	Activate jetpack (hold for continuous thrust)

🧑‍💻 Development Notes

This project was created for educational and portfolio purposes as part of
🎓 The Ultimate Developer Course (Udemy)

All gameplay systems, Blueprints, and UI elements were built by me
followed by course

My main goals during development were:

Learning and applying Unreal Engine 5’s Enhanced Input system

Designing reusable, interface-driven Blueprint logic

Creating smooth player feedback through animation and UI

Building a clean, organized project structure suitable for future expansion

📸 Screenshots

(Upload all your screenshots into a folder named Media/ and reference them here once you’re ready.)


Main gameplay loop — jetpack navigation and platform progression.

💬 Final Thoughts

Jetpack Kix started as a course project but evolved into a complete, polished prototype that demonstrates core Unreal Engine gameplay systems.
From designing modular Blueprint logic to integrating input, animation, and UI — this project showcases my understanding of UE5’s gameplay framework.
